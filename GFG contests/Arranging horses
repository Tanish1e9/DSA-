Weekly 154

Given was some orderings that certain horses should appear before certain horses and we had to return the complete ordering of the horses that respects them
If there are multiple possible return lexicographically smallest

In such questions think of Topo Sort. 
but In DFS wala topo sort we cant control lexicographically ordering
so we use kahn's but with priority queue
