- In BFS, queue me node daalte waqt hi usko visited mark kr dena h wrna unnecessarily queue ka size bada hoke TLE dega
- dfs me dfs call krne k pehle mark kro chahe baad me fark ni padta
- if all the edges have weight 1 and we have to find shortest path, we don't need priority queue, queue se hi kaam ho jayega
- cycle detection in undirected graph
  - vis array and par is required. agar koi already visited node 'p' kisi node 'q' k neighbour me aa jaye and it is not q's parent then cycle is there
  - can be implemented using dfs and bfs easily
- cycle detection in directed graph
  - we need path_vis array but no par is required. think about 1->2->3 and also 1->4->3. If we dont use path_vis, then iss case pe bhi cycle aa jayega which is wrong
  - dfs se kr skte h easily, but bfs me kahn's algo lagega. In kahn's also, we dont require another vis array (since indegree hi kind of kaam kr dega)
- Optimisations in dijkstra
  - Set use kr skte h. Extra line-> agar neighbour me check krte waqt koi kam distance mil gya then original distance, uss node ke pair ko remove kr dena set se
  - In PQ, agar pq se pair pop kie and we get a different distance as compared to the one in distances vector then just skip that node
